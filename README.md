Amazing-Er-Maps
===============
There's a lot of **bad** maps out there. Let's fix'em. 

The goal of the Amazing-er Maps project is to *improve* the one - off maps shared endlessly
across the internet. By using GitHub as the repository, we can open the data sources used
in these maps, while improving their cartographic quality.

Ideally, an interactive map, via MapBox, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB, or some other source
would be delivery method. Hosting cost aside, a project file from desktop software
and an image export will do.


To add a new map to this repo:
* Store all files in folder named after the map
* **Must** include data source (pdf, csv, etc) Not a link!
* **Must** include GeoJSON of data
  * Bonus - zipped shapefile, lyr files, etc
* Map project file (TileMill, ArcMap, QGis)
* Image of new map
  * Bonus - link to online map!
* Add read me to folder including: map name, general location, website found on, website link, source name, source link
* Update the main repo MapTracker csv


I've created 5 examples based on some "amazing" maps. 

Please comment/ask any questions.
