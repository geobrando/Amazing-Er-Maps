Amazing-Er-Maps
===============
There's a lot of **bad** maps out there. Let's fix'em.

To add a new map to this repo:
* Store all files in folder named after the map
* Must include data source (pdf, csv, etc) Not a link!
* Must include GeoJSON of data
  * **Bonus** Zipped shapefile, lyr files, etc
* Image of new map
* Map project file (TileMill, ArcMap, QGis)
  * **Bonus** Link to online map!
* Add read me to folder including: map name, general location, website found on, website link, source name, source link
* Add same info to the main repo csv


I've created 5 examples based on some "amazing" maps. 

Please comment/ask any questions.
