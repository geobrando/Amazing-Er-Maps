###New! [Amazing-er Maps Presentation!]( http://jonahadkins.github.io/Amazing-Er-Maps)

There's a lot of ~~bad~~ **unique** maps out there.

The goal of the Amazing-er Maps project is to *improve* the one - off maps shared endlessly
across the internet. By using GitHub as the repository, we can open the data sources used
in these maps, while improving their cartographic quality.

An interactive map, via MapBox, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB, or some other resource
would be the ideal delivery method, but a project file from desktop software and an image export will do as well.


To add a new map to this repo:
* Store all files in folder named after the map
* **Must** include data source (pdf, csv, etc - preferred) or link to durable source
* **Must** include GeoJSON of data (small sets) or zipped shapefile (large sets)
* Map project file (TileMill, ArcMap, QGis)
* Link to online map or image of new map
* Add read me to folder including: map name, general location, website found on, website link, source name, source link
* Update the main repo MapTracker csv


I've created 7 examples based on some "amazing" maps.
* [Current Drought Reduction](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/jonahadkins.hbo4co23/page.html?secure=1#4/40.45/-92.90)
* [GDP By Metro Statistical Area](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/jonahadkins.hal8980h/page.html?secure=1#5/38.273/-94.438) And [Population By Metro Statistical Area](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/jonahadkins.hb0g86h7/page.html?secure=1#5/38.221/-96.680)

I'm also creating How To's for anyone with a general knowledge of how maps and data are created to use:
* [Making Your Map Amazing-er With ArcGIS Online](https://github.com/jonahadkins/Amazing-Er-Maps/blob/master/HowToArcGISOnline.md)
* [Making Your Map Amazing-er With MapBox](https://github.com/jonahadkins/Amazing-Er-Maps/blob/master/HowToMapBox.md)


Please suggest/comment/ask and contribute, definitely contribute.
